# Assignments

This is where you will find the assignments for the class, each one in its own numbered directory. The directory 
for an assignment will typically contain a `README` file which will contain all the instructions for the assignment.

I'll say more about how you should connect your work to this repository once I have a chance to work through it with
you in person.

One thing I will say now is that the `README` for the prework assignment is much longer than I will write for any
other assignment!
