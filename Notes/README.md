## Class Notes

This will be the home for any material that is related to the subject matter of the class but is not part of an assignment.

Explanations, instructions, links to resources, those sorts of things. 

Information about the class but not about the subject matter - class policies, assignment submission instructions, etc - can be found in the [class wiki](../../../wiki).
